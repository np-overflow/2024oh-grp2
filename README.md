(P.S: Remember to `pip install -r requirements.txt` before trying to run anything, and make sure to update it if you use any imports)

## Workflow

ENSURE CODE PASSES UNIT TESTS BEFORE PUSHING OR WRITE UNIT TESTS FOR THEM IF NOT APPLICABLE

1. Save all changes
2. `pip install pipreqs` if not already installed
3. `pipreqs .` and remove `Render` and/or `Transform` if applicable
4. Push to the right branch :\)
